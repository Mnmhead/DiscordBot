COMPILE:
javac -d bin -sourcepath src -cp lib/lib1.jar;lib/lib2.jar src/com/example/Application.java

destination -> bin
sourcepath -> src, the folder which contains files to compile
we are compiling Application.java which rests in the com.example package
the -cp tag is classpath (i think), we are using lib1 and lib2 jar


RUN:
java -cp bin;lib/lib1.jar;lib/lib2.jar com.example.Application

we specifiy to classpath and inluced the bin folder (now the location of the .class file)
and we specify the library files. Then we specify, not the filepath, but the classname which includes
the package names.
