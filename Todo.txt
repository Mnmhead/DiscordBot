Need to make debug util a singleton class that always exists, so that every class can call debugPrint all the time. It is implemented incorrectly right now.

Add commands to print new user information
   - show game activity data
  - store user game time in each game!? Can I do that?!
   
4. Add headers in the helptext for command groups to segregate the commands into
   sections. This way it is clear what each command does because it is sort of given a context
   - this is harder than I thought because the CmdMgr doesnt have any idea about CmdGroups...

5. finish the novel writer:
   - fix the regex
   - add a start and stop command
   - add a vote to skip command
