Need to make debug util a singleton class that always exists, so that every class can call debugPrint all the time. It is implemented incorrectly right now.

Add commands to print new user information
   - show game activity data
  - store user game time in each game!? Can I do that?!

Add a boot class that initializes everything. Or maybe some sort of boot method or something...
  I need to make sure
   - (future) text files of database is read from and brought into memory
   - login users who are in a voice chat currently
   - load the previous mute status of the bot
   - load novelWriter state (whatever that may be)

Definitely need a database or something. Some SQL shit or something like that

5. finish the novel writer:
   - fix the regex
   - add a start and stop command
   - add a vote to skip command
